# ESPNOW-json
#### example implementation of encrypted ESPNOW sensor - gateway with json messaging and control
ESPNOW is a very cool and lean protocol which links ESP32/ESP8266 devices over wifi. This can form a very robust, extensible sensor/control  network. This is coupled with json messaging and with NodeRED as the backend can form an excellent control network.
